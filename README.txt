IP location database using a Trie data structure.

Reads in IP location data from a configuration file.
Adds data to a trie structure using included Trie ADT.
Allows for fast and easy closest location search.

Allows for full and partial "dotted" IP address searches:
>> EX: 55.3 = 55.3.0.0
>> EX: 55.3.22.12

Allows for pure numerical searches (converted to raw 4-byte value):
>> EX: 16817663
